      "A legendary figure within the galaxy, Yoda served as a wise and powerful Jedi Master for over eight centuries. Born nearly 900 years before the Battle of Yavin, Yoda's origins and the specifics of his species remain one of the galaxy's great mysteries. As a leading figure within the Jedi Council, Yoda played pivotal roles during the twilight years of the Galactic Republic, guiding young Jedi and providing sage counsel during the political upheavals and wars that defined the era. Yet, it was his wisdom and foresight that led him into seclusion after the rise of the Empire, ensuring that the ways of the Jedi would be passed on to a new generation, notably training Luke Skywalker, the last hope for the galaxy. Throughout his life, Yoda's deep connection to the Force and his commitment to balance made him a beacon of hope and an enduring symbol of Jedi values.",

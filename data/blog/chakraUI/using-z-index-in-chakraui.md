## ChakraUI z-indexing

```js
Can I still use z-index alongside Portals?
Yes, there are many cases where this will make sense.

As a general rule, we recommend not exceeding z-index values of more than 1 or 2, and to use stacking contexts to combat more complex stacking issues.
```

I haven't had to use z-index > 3 so far in my app design.

## Konva setup

I started with a complete Konva setup with React. I used the React Konva starter thathas the green stars and started tweaking it to my needs. I am using it for a DND interactive map and need to have different icons and experiences.

### Few things I needed to adjust:

#### Setting boundaries for the draggable objects

The inital set up allowed icons to leave the Konva canvas and I didn't want that. Here is my solution:

```js const dragBoundFunc = (pos) => {
    const x = Math.max(
      playerRadius,
      Math.min(pos.x, stageSize.width - playerRadius)
    );
    const y = Math.max(
      playerRadius,
      Math.min(pos.y, stageSize.height - playerRadius)
    );
    return { x, y };
  };
```

#### Added SVG's with icons that represent DND classes that start in a similar location.

I wanted to add some starter classes: Fighter, Barbarian, and Wizard but I had some issues with sizing on the FighterPath. After a bunch of attempted fixes I adjusted the scale outside of the Player component and that seemed to work. Still not completely sure why the Fighter SVG was larger but that is a struggle for another day.

```js
import React from 'react';
import { Group, Path, Text } from 'react-konva';

const FighterIcon = (
  <Group scale={{ x: 0.08, y: 0.08 }}>
    <Path
      data="M255.996 0C209.875 55.353 136.065 87.638 53.039 92.25v189.12C53.039 405.914 255.996 512 255.996 512s202.966-106.086 202.966-230.63V92.25C375.926 87.638 302.116 55.353 255.996 0z"
      fill="white"
      stroke="grey"
      strokeWidth={1}
      viewBox="0 0 48 48"
    />
  </Group>
);

const Player = ({ id, name, x, y, draggable, dragBoundFunc, className }) => {
  const radius = 20;
  const classShape = () => {
    switch (className) {
      case 'barbarian':
        return (
          <Path
            data="m13.742 21.83 8.272-8.272-.441-.441 1.875-1.875-2.726-2.726-1.875 1.875-.441-.441-.341.341c-1.184-2.35-.963-5.218 1.157-8.84C8.92-2.685-2.193 9.862 1.372 19.7c3.339-1.941 6.782-2.769 9.352-2.067l-.589.589.441.441-9.905 9.905v2.838h2.614l10.017-10.017.441.441zm16.836-9.023c-3.673 2.149-6.565 2.354-8.93 1.117l-7.278 7.278c.755 2.58-.072 6.068-2.041 9.455 9.838 3.564 22.385-7.548 18.249-17.85z"

        );
      case 'fighter':
        return FighterIcon;
      default:
        return null;
    }
  };

  return (
    <Group
      id={id}
      x={x}
      y={y}
      draggable={draggable}
      dragBoundFunc={dragBoundFunc}

        fontSize={16}
        fontStyle="bold"
        fill="white"
      />
    </Group>
  );
};

export default Player;
```

Pretty happy with the inital set up but there is still a long way to go!

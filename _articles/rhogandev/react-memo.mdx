Here are my notes and discoveries regarding React.memo.

## 1.17.23

### When do I use React.memo?

[Source](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html#reactmemo)

> If your function component renders the same result given the same props, you can wrap it in a call to React.memo for a performance boost in some cases by memoizing the result. This means that React will skip rendering the component, and reuse the last rendered result.

### My Findings

Basically, you want to use it on simple components that has primitive prop(s). Memoization concept and React.memo are pretty different. React.memo is a lot simplier and reduced in scope. The best way to use React.memo is when your component has limited prop options.

For example, if you have a component that has a prop of `color` and it can only be `red`, `blue`, or `green`, then you can use React.memo. If you have a component that has a prop of `color` and it can be any color, then you should not use React.memo.

Each time React.memo renders a new color then we can cache the result. If the color is the same, then we can use the cached result. This is a simple example of how React.memo works.

### Example

```jsx
import React from 'react';

const Color = ({ color }) => {
  console.log('rendering');
  return <div style={{ color }}>{color}</div>;
};

const MemoizedColor = React.memo(Color);

const App = () => {
  const [color, setColor] = React.useState('red');
  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => setColor('red')}>Red</button>
      <button onClick={() => setColor('blue')}>Blue</button>
      <button onClick={() => setColor('green')}>Green</button>
      <MemoizedColor color={color} />
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

### Conclusion

React.memo is a great tool to use when you have a component that has limited prop options. It is not a tool to use when you have a component that has a prop that can be any value. It is a tool to use when you have a component that has a prop that can only be a limited set of values.

export default ({ children }) => (
  <BlogLayout meta={meta}>{children}</BlogLayout>
);

# Notes and review of December 2022.

## December 5th

Today I worked on moving a Next.js project using Yarn as the package manager to a Nx monorepo. I am going to use pnpm for the monorepo package management based on some of the benchmarks they brag about [pnpm] (https://pnpm.io/benchmarks).

I ran into a build error I couldn't figure out regarding a .scss file. I tried following the NEXT.js recommendation: npm install --save-dev sass but still couldn't resolve the issue. I am working with another developer and we are setting up a reusable/sharable video editor. The current implementation is using React.js with a Ruby backend using Electron.js. We are porting the editor over to NEXT.js and REST api stack.

Other error(s) I ran into were related to pnpm install issues. I had 4-5 libraries that wouldn't install with the recommended npm install commands. I really haven't used pnpm much so I'm sure there is a easy solution to this.

Outside of the scss and pnpm issue, most of the transition was pretty smooth. I copied over the folders opening two VS Codes and drag and dropping the folders to their new home. Then working through the library issues.

I'm excited to start building out the components and libraries!

## December 6th

Today I worked with another developer to plan out our video editor components across a Electron and Next.JS applications. We talked about having a few different UI libraries to start with and use across our apps. Two of our applications use ChakraUI pretty heavily and the other is pure react with scss. Eventually, we want to use pure react components for performance. The ChakraUI library will be mostly to deliver quick features and used heavily to quickly communicate ideas back to the shareholders.

I also worked on a multi-step checkout form for our customer uploads. I found an example online and use it as a model. Right now, the multi-step checkout is purely UX with the back-end coming soon. I'll have to do various file size checks and progress bar updates in the process. I have a rough idea but I will be waiting to dive in until I receive the back-end needs.

I'm excited to start making the components truely reusable across all our apps!

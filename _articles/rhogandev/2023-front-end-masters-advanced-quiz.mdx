# FrontEndMasters: Advanced Web Dev Quiz

## Question #1

Put the scripts in the right order of execution

<script async src="async2.js" /> // 50ms
<script async defer="asyncdefer1.js" /> // 60ms
<script async src="async1.js" /> // 300ms
<script defer src="defer1.js" /> // 200ms
<script defer src="defer2.js" /> // 300ms MY ANSWER: D, E, A, B, C CORRECT! ### Thoght
process and explanation I am assuming the async script will fire first and the lowest
ms scripts will excucute first. Followed up by the defer scripts by lowest ms. LEARNED:
Async takes priority over defer Using the term "discovered" is better when describing
the order of execution of scripts. ## Question #2 Which statements are true? The
render tree contains all elements from the DOM and CSSOM combined Compositing is
the process of separating layers based on elements z-index, which are then combined
to form the final image displayed on the screen The layout process assigns positions
and sizes to the visual elements in the render tree The composting process happens
on the compositor thread Elements that aren't visible on the page, for example display:
hidden, aren't part of the DOM tree MY ANSWER: wasn't sure and didn't want to guess
WRONG! ### Breakdown of each question and answer A: The render tree contains all
elements from the DOM and CSSOM combined (FALSE) ONLY the visual elements not all
Elements B: Compositing is the process of separating layers based on elements z-index,
which are then combined to form the final image displayed on the screen (FALSE) Compositing
is the process of combining the layers to form the final image displayed on the screen.
Z-index is used to determine the order of the layers, but it doesn't separate them.
C: The layout process assigns positions and sizes to the visual elements in the render
tree (FALSE) Happens during the PAINT proccess not the layout process D: The composting
process happens on the compositor thread (TRUE) E: Elements that aren't visible on
the page, for example display: hidden, aren't part of the DOM tree (FALSE) They are
still part of the DOM tree

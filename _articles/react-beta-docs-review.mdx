Here are my notes and review of the React beta docs.

## 12.5.22

### Creating and nesting components

[Source](]https://beta.reactjs.org/learn#components)

This section was mostly review. I am comfortable with nested components in general.

From a performance and best practice view, I want to have a better understanding when and where to use export default. I typically declare the component

// MyApp.js

function MyApp() {
return (
//...JSX
)
}

export default MyApp;

Other times I use:

//MyApp.js

export default function MyApp() {
return (
// JSX
)
}

While both of these compile, I need to dig into the details.

## 1.16.23

### What is JSX?

[Source](https://beta.reactjs.org/learn#jsx)

I was reviewing the documentation and came across the word JSX. I realized I didn't have a good way in describing the term even though I use it every day. I decided to look up the definition and found this:

JSX (JavaScript Syntax Extension and occasionally referred as JavaScript XML) is a React extension to the JavaScript language syntax[1] which provides a way to structure component rendering using syntax familiar to many developers. It is similar in appearance to HTML.

React components are typically written using JSX, although they do not have to be as components may also be written in pure JavaScript. JSX is created by Meta (formerly Facebook).[1][2] It is similar to another extension syntax created by Meta for PHP called XHP.

Basically, JSX allows you to write HTML in JavaScript that feels really familiar to non JS frameworks.

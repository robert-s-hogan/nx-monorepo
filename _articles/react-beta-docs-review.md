Here are my notes and review of the React beta docs.

## Creating and nesting components

[Source](]https://beta.reactjs.org/learn#components)

This section was mostly review. I am comfortable with nested components in general.

12.5.22

From a performance and best practice view, I want to have a better understanding when and where to use export default. I typically declare the component

// MyApp.js

function MyApp() {
return (
//...JSX
)
}

export default MyApp;

Other times I use:

//MyApp.js

export default function MyApp() {
return (
// JSX
)
}

While both of these compile, I need to dig into the details.
